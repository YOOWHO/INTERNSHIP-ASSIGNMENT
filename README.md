# React Spreadsheet Assignment

A modern, interactive spreadsheet application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project replicates a professional spreadsheet UI with interactive components and responsive design.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Deployed on Render:** https://internship-assignment-ss6d.onrender.com
**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/YOOWHO/INTERNSHIP-ASSIGNMENT

## 📋 Project Overview

This project was built as an intern assignment to demonstrate proficiency in:
- React with TypeScript
- Modern UI/UX design
- Component architecture
- State management
- Responsive design
- Deployment and CI/CD

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Deployment:** Render (Static Site)
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub

## 🏗️ How We Built This Project

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture
1. **Initial Setup:** Created React + TypeScript project using Vite
2. **UI Framework:** Integrated shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible components
3. **Styling:** Configured Tailwind CSS with custom theme
4. **Project Structure:** Organized components, pages, and utilities

### Phase 2: UI Replication
1. **Header Section:** Implemented breadcrumbs, search bar, notification bell, and user profile
2. **Toolbar:** Created interactive button groups with proper click handlers
3. **Spreadsheet Table:** Built responsive table with:
   - Status pills (Active, Pending, Completed)
   - Priority indicators (High, Medium, Low)
   - Clickable links and data cells
   - Proper hover states and interactions
4. **Group Headers:** Added styled group rows with icons and background colors
5. **Bottom Tabs:** Implemented navigation tabs with active states

### Phase 3: Interactivity & Functionality
1. **Event Handlers:** Added console logging for all interactive elements
2. **Responsive Design:** Ensured mobile-friendly layout
3. **TypeScript:** Implemented proper type safety throughout
4. **Component Architecture:** Created reusable, modular components

### Phase 4: Code Quality & Optimization
1. **Linting:** Fixed all ESLint errors and warnings
2. **Type Checking:** Ensured TypeScript compilation passes
3. **Configuration:** Optimized build settings and dependencies
4. **Documentation:** Updated README and code comments

## 🚧 Problems We Faced & Solutions

### 1. **Tailwind Configuration Issues**
**Problem:** `tailwindcss-animate` plugin was incorrectly imported in the plugins array
**Solution:** Fixed by properly importing at the top and referencing in plugins array
```typescript
// Before (Broken)
plugins: [import("tailwindcss-animate")]

// After (Fixed)
import tailwindcssAnimate from "tailwindcss-animate";
plugins: [tailwindcssAnimate]
```

### 2. **Linting Errors**
**Problem:** Multiple ESLint errors including empty interfaces and import issues
**Solution:** 
- Removed empty interfaces
- Fixed import/require conflicts
- Added missing type-check script to package.json

### 3. **Formula Support Challenges**
**Problem:** Attempted to implement spreadsheet formula functionality but faced architectural limitations
**Solution:** Decided to focus on UI/UX excellence instead, removing formula references from documentation

### 4. **Deployment Configuration**
**Problem:** GitHub Pages deployment workflow failed initially
**Solution:** Switched to Render deployment for simpler, more reliable hosting

### 5. **PowerShell Command Issues**
**Problem:** Some Unix commands (like `grep`) don't work in PowerShell
**Solution:** Used PowerShell-specific commands and Git Bash alternatives

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Option 1: Render (Chosen)
1. **Repository Setup:** Pushed code to GitHub repository
2. **Render Configuration:**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `dist`
   - Environment: Static Site
3. **Automatic Deployment:** Render automatically builds and deploys on each push

### Option 2: GitHub Pages (Alternative)
1. **Workflow Setup:** Created GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Configuration:** Updated vite.config.ts for proper base path
3. **Deployment:** Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions
